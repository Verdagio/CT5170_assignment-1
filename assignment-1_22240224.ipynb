    "Some of the most popular machine learing libraries for python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow** - Developed by Google, written in Python and C++, it offers a free and open-source library used for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. The library offers both a high-level and low-level API to users to enable creating machine leanring models which can be run on many different host devices including, cloud, desktop, mobile or even on edge devices. It offers tools to validate and transform large datasets, and tools to discover and remove bias in data to improve outcomes on models. Tensoflow offers in depth API documentation and learning materials for users of all experience levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keras** - Is a machine learning API written purely in Python, which runs on top of the TensorFlow platform. It offers an easy to use high-level API which abstracts some of the more complex functionality of TensorFlow. Keras offers a quick and easy way to get up and running for smaller projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch** - Developed by the Linux Foundation and Meta AI (a branch of Meta, formerly Facebook) was released in September 2016. The library is written in Python, CUDA and C++, and offers a machine learning framework based on the Torch library. It can be used to develop machine learning applications and also offers capabilities for the creation of REST API endpoint to ease application integration. It only offers low level apis so it can be more difficult to use than Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning library that I will be using here is [Keras](https://keras.io/). Its ease of use makes carrying out tasks like the one we are tackling today quick and easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Keras library over something like the TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries will reduce the amount of effort on my part to build the neural network, and should also be fairly easy to read and understand for you, the reader. As this dataset is quite small and relatively trivial using one of the other options, while they may operate faster, would add an unnecessary level of complexity as we should not need to dig into the lower level apis, or spend a lot of time debugging our neural network."
